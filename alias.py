USAGE = """USAGE: {prog} <COMMAND> <ARGS>
Manages aliases.  With this, you don't need to remember any ID,
because {prog} does it for you.

{prog} list {{ --alias | --station | --unaliased }} [ <NAME_PART> ]
Lists the respective thing.  <NAME_FRAG> filters the list:
Matching elements need to have <NAME_FRAG> as substring.
--alias: All defined aliases.
--station: All known stations.
--unaliased: All known stations which do not have an alias.

{prog} set <ALIAS> <ID_OR_ALIAS_OR_NAME_FRAG>
Sets a new alias <ALIAS> for <ID_OR_ALIAS_OR_NAME_FRAG>.
Aliases must not start with a zero.
The latter may be either of:
- A SaarVV-internal ID like "000010043".
- A known alias.  Note that this alias is immediately resolved;
  in other words, it's not a "symbolic link".
- A name fragment.  There must be exactly one known station with this name fragment

{prog} show {{ <ID> | <ALIAS> }}
Shows information about the ID or alias.
